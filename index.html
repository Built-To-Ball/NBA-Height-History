        <div id="intro">
          <p>Basketball is a game of endurance, precision, agility, and speed. 
            It takes years of dedication and hard work to become a professional 
            athlete. For basketball however, it can take a little more than just that.
            Out of the four major professional sports leagues, the NBA is the only league
            where the players can be spotted at any public venue, simply because of their height.
            This page is dedicated to exploring the significance of a player's genetic makeup in their
            ability to make it to the NBA and how it has impacted the game of basketball over the years.

        <!-- Height Chart -->
        <div id="heightchart">
          <h2>How tall is the average NBA player?</h2>
          <p>An NBA basketball hoop stands at 120 inches off the floor. The goal of an NBA 
            player is simple, get the ball in the bucket, and prevent the other team from
            doing the same. This gives a distinct natural advantage to those who are able 
            to reach the hoop better than others. The longer your legs, the higher you can
            jump, the more ground you can cover. The longer your arms, the higher you can reach and
            the wider you can touch. It is quite simple to see why people who are taller are
            more inclined to succeed in the game of basketball. But how big of a distinction
            is there between the height of an NBA player, and the height of an average man 
            on the streets?
          </p>
          <div class="hchart"></div>
          <p>The average American male is 69 inches tall, to put this into perspective, out
            of the 400+ active NBA players in the league at the beginning of 2018, 
            only one player, Isaiah Thomas, is the same height as that of an average American
            male. Not a single player is shorter than 69 inches.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Height History -->
        <div id="history">
          <h2>Have NBA players always been this tall?</h2>
          <p>The trend of having tall basketball players dates back to the inaugural season
            in 1946-1947 when the league was known as the BAA, the Basketball Association
            of America. Among the 160 players on 11 different teams, only 2 players stood 
            below 69 inches.
          </p>
          <div class="histgraph"></div>
          <p>The above chart shows the height distribution of NBA players over the course
            of the last 70 years. Although the distribution differs slightly from year to 
            year, the median has stayed between 75 and 80 inches. The chart below shows the
            clear increase in the average height of players.
          </p>
          <div class="avglinegraph"></div>
          <p>The increase in exposure of players around the world, mixed with scientific 
            research into training and optimal nutrition has helped to slowly increase 
            the average height of NBA players from 1947 to the mid 1980's. The average height
            has stayed relatively stable over the last 20 years. This may be due to several 
            reasons, one of which is certainly the introduction of the three point line in 1980.
            The three point line has changed the dynamic of basketball and has put more focus on the 
            development of agile and coordinated players rather than those who purely dominate
            the rim. A shorter guard who is able to consistently hit threes is now worth just
            as much if not more than a pure center with a much lower three point shooting percentage.
          </p>

        <!-- <div id="positions">
            <h2>Guards vs Forwards vs Centers</h2>
            <p>It is also important to keep in mind that the listed heights of NBA players may
              differ from their actual height. Often times, a player's height may impact the
              positions they are able to play, not because they don't possess the skills
              necessary to play a certain position but simply because of the expectations 
              placed on the stature of a specific position player. For example, Kevin Durant 
              is listed at 81 inches because that is typically the tallest height for 
              a small forward. Even though he may be 82-84 inches tall, due to his listed 
              height, coaches and organizations are more inclined to let him be a small forward
              rather than switch him to a power forward or center position.
            </p>
            <p>A basketball player over 7 feet (84 inches) tall is rarely ever seen playing 
              anything other than the center position. With the exception of recent years, it 
              would be a miracle to see a 7 feet tall center shoot a three since their training
              was heavily focused on dominating the area around the rim. This introduces another 
              question, how does a basketball player's height affect the positions they are 
              given the oppurtunity to play?
            </p>

        <div id="weight">
          <h2>The Big Boys: Introducing Shaquille O'Neal</h2>
          <p>The NBA may not be getting any taller, but it is sure getting heavier. Shaquille O'Neal is 
            one of the most dominant centers to have played in the NBA. During his rookie
            year, Shaq was a 7-foot-1 294 lb beast who was almost unstoppable around the rim.
            Shaq reached his peak during the Los Angeles Lakers three-peat, at which point  
            he was weighing in at over 340 lbs with little to no remorse for anyone who got in his way.
            The pure dominance of someone as heavy as Shaq, paved the way for heavier players in the NBA.
            To compensate for the trend of moving towards more agile and cooridnated players, the need 
            for bigger and stronger players who can dominate not just the rim but the entire court increased greatly. 
          </p>
          <div class="avgwlinechart"></div>
          <p>Before Shaq's rookie year, only 2% (59/2692) of all NBA players are listed at 
            over 250lbs. However, in the 25 years since, over 17% (316/1858) percent of all NBA 
            players are listed at over 250lbs.

          <h2>Heart over Height</h2>
          <p>Yes, it does help to be tall if you want to become a professional basketball
            player in the NBA. Yes, you do have a major advantage if can touch the rim
            with a little hop or without even leaving the floor. But don't let that stop you.
            Here's a list of "short" players that proved that the size of your heart matters
            than the size of your shoes.
