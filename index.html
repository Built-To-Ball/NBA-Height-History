      <h1>Built To Ball</h1>
      <h2>A breakdown of the NBA's genetic history</h2>
      <!-- Intro -->
      <div id="intro">
        <p>Basketball is a game of endurance, precision, agility, and speed. 
           It takes years of dedication and hard work to become a professional 
           athlete, for basketball however, it can take a little more than just that.
           Out of the four major professional sports leagues, the NBA is the only league
           where the players can be spotted at any public venue, simply because of their height.
           This page is dedicated to exploring the significance of a player's height in their
           ability to make it to the NBA and how an NBA player's height and genetic makeup
           has impacted the game of basketball over the years.
        </p>
        <p>An NBA basketball hoop stands at 120 inches off the floor. The goal of an NBA 
          player is simple, get the ball in the bucket, and prevent the other team from
          doing the same. This gives a distinct natural advantage to those who are able 
          to reach the hoop better than others. The longer your legs, the higher you can
          jump, the more ground you can cover. The longer your arms, the higher you can reach and
          the wider you can touch. It is quite simple to see why people who are taller are
          more inclined to succeed in the game of basketball. But how big of a distinction
          is there between the height of an NBA player, and the height of an average man 
          on the streets?

        <p>The average American male is 69 inches tall, to put this into perspective, out
           of the 400+ active NBA players in the league at the beginning of 2018, 
           only one player, Isaiah Thomas, is the same height as that of an average American
           male. Not a single player is shorter than 69 inches.

      <!-- Height History -->
      <div id="history">
        <div class="histgraph"></div>
        <p>The trend of having tall basketball players dates back to the inaugural season
           in 1946-1947 when the league was known as the BAA, the Basketball Association
           of America. Among the 160 players on 11 different teams, only 2 players stood 
           below <a>69 inches tall</a>.
