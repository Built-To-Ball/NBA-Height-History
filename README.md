# Built To Ball
## A breakdown of the NBA's genetic history

Work in Progress

### Inspired by my fascination with visualizations mixed with my passion for sports.

Basketball is a game of endurance, precision, agility, and speed. It takes years of dedication and hard work to become a professional athlete, for basketball however, it can take a little more than just that. Out of the four major professional sports leagues, the NBA is the only league where the players can be spotted at any public venue, simply because of their height. This project is dedicated to exploring the significance of a player's height in their ability to make it to the NBA and how an NBA player's height and genetic makeup has impacted the game of basketball over the years.
